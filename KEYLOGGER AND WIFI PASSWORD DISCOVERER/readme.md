The python scripts i wrote can be converted into exe formats by using the module `pyinstaller`, this can also be used to embed icons for the `.exe` files. You can 
use the format: `pyinstaller filename.py --onefile --icon filename.ico --noconsole`
follow the documentation on the [website](https://pyinstaller.org/)

- After that cmd into the wifi/wifi2 to get the wifi passwords stored in the computer
- As for the logger.exe, firstly install the USB autorun creator. I used [this](https://www.samlogic.net/demos/demos.htm)


`**Note:** You can use any autorun creator.`

After the installation and modification of the USB thumbdrive. Re-insert it and it should store all keystrokes into a `logfile`
