- Understanding the fundamental differences between various forms of malware, such as worms and viruses, is crucial. The analogy to biological counterparts can aid in remembering their distinct characteristics and methods of propagation.

### Lecture Notes: Understanding Ransomware

- **Definition of Ransomware:**
  - Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts the user's files or locks the user out of their device. A message then demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key or to regain access.

- **Common Presentation:**
 - Often, victims encounter a splash screen on their computers indicating that their files have been locked.
 - The ransom demand usually includes a specific payment amount (e.g., 5 bitcoins) and a deadline (e.g., before 11:30).

- **Impact on Organizations and Individuals:**
  - Ransomware attacks can target both personal devices and the networks of entire organizations, leading to significant operational disruptions and financial losses.

- **Awareness:**
 - Due to its prevalence, ransomware is a widely recognized cybersecurity threat in news reports and among organizations across various sectors.

Lecture Notes:

- Threat actors may lock all files of a large organization within a short timeframe (e.g., 48 hours).
- In addition to locking files, these actors may also exfiltrate large amounts of data (gigabytes) from the organization.
- The threat actors then use the exfiltrated data as leverage, implying they will release or otherwise misuse the data unless their demands are met.

## Overview of Session Hijacking

- **Unnoticed Intrusion:** Users may not realize when their sessions are hijacked, as the attacker seamlessly takes over an ongoing connection.
- **TCP Communication Basis:** Session hijacking occurs during valid TCP communication between two hosts, where attackers intercept and manipulate the traffic for malicious purposes.

## Success Factors and Vulnerabilities

- **Account Lockout Absence:** Successful hijacking is facilitated when there's no account lockout mechanism, allowing attackers to persistently attempt unauthorized access.
- **Weak Session ID Handling:** Vulnerabilities arise from invalid or weak algorithms managing session IDs, making it easier for attackers to predict and exploit them.
- **Predictability in TCP/IP:** Common predictability in TCP/IP sessions, especially in computers running TCP and UDP, becomes an advantage for hijackers.
- **Ineffective Countermeasures:** Traditional countermeasures are rendered ineffective without encryption, emphasizing the crucial role of encryption in preventing session hijacking.

## Process of Session Hijacking

1. **Placement Between Victim and Target:**
   - Attackers position themselves between the victim and the target, monitoring network traffic.

2. **Packet Sniffing and Monitoring:**
   - Attackers sniff and monitor packets, understanding the flow of TCP segments and predicting sequence numbers.

3. **De-Synchronization:**
   - Through calculated de-synchronization, attackers divert the TCP session, leading to confusion between the synchronized hosts.

4. **Predictive Takeover:**
   - Attackers predictably take over the session, injecting their own packets into the server and gaining control.

## Passive and Active Session Hijacking

- **Passive Hijacking:** Attackers observe the session without actively controlling it, often for data collection purposes.
- **Active Hijacking:** Attackers seize control of the session, enabling them to manipulate the communication actively.

## Levels of Session Hijacking Based on OSI Model

- **Layer 3 (Network Layer):**
   - Involves intercepting packets at the network layer (OSI Layer 3) where IP addresses and protocols reside.

- **Layer 4 (Transport Layer):**
   - Focuses on TCP and UDP sessions (OSI Layer 4) and initiates hijacking starting from Layer 3.

- **Layer 7 (Application Layer):**
   - Targets the application layer (OSI Layer 7), gaining control over specific applications like HTTP user sessions.

## Spoofing vs. Hijacking

- **Spoofing:** Pretending to be something else by altering IP or MAC addresses.
  
- **Hijacking:** Actively taking over an existing session, giving control to the attacker.

In summary, understanding the intricacies of session hijacking involves recognizing vulnerabilities, predicting attacker methods, and implementing effective countermeasures, with encryption playing a pivotal role in mitigating this pervasive threat.

## Access Control Principles, Terminology, and Models

Let's jump into the first section where we discuss access control principles, terminology, and models. After that, we'll delve into IAM (Identity Access Management) and explore its concepts.

Access control involves selective restriction, ensuring not everyone has access to everything. For example, I wouldn't want just anyone to access my medical records or my hypothetical cache of 7,000 Bitcoin. Instead, only authorized individuals such as specific medical professionals should have access to my medical records, and only certain personnel should have access to sensitive financial information.

Similarly, in a network environment like XYZ Corp, we ensure that only authorized individuals have access to relevant information. We use authentication functions to authenticate users and protect information from unauthorized access.

### Terminology and Setting Up Access Control

Access control involves entities requiring access to resources (e.g., users, processes, programs) and objects (resources like printers, files, applications) to which access is needed.

- **Entity:** Requires access to a resource.
- **Object:** Resource to which access is required.
- **Reference Monitor:** Checks access based on rules for authentication and authorization.
- **Operation:** Determines access (granted or denied) based on the reference monitor's decision.

### Access Control Principles

1. **Separation of Duties (SoD):** Divides the authorization process into steps with different privileges assigned to individuals to avoid one person having all authorization rights.
2. **Need-to-Know:** Provides access only to information required for job tasks, ensuring individuals only access relevant data.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege (POLP):** Grants only the necessary privilege for job tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or accidental misuse of privileges.

### Access Control Models

1. **MAC (Mandatory Access Control):** Administrator or system owner assigns privileges, and end-users cannot modify access permissions.
2. **DAC (Discretionary Access Control):** Users have control over their resources and can assign access to others, often leading to MAC implementations.
3. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Assigns access based on roles or groups, ensuring individuals get necessary access for their job roles.
4. **RB-RBAC (Rule-Based Role-Based Access Control):** Dynamically adjusts access based on predefined rules, accommodating changing circumstances and environments.

In implementations, access control may involve User Account Control (UAC), Access Control Lists (ACLs), group policies, passwords, and account restrictions.

#### Logical Implementations

- **JEA (Just Enough Administration):** Provides limited administrative capabilities to specific users, ideal for scenarios where users need to perform specific tasks.
- **WAC (Windows Admin Center):** Implements RBAC, allowing administrators to manage network resources and create custom roles for fine-grained access control.

These models and principles form the foundation of effective access control strategies, ensuring secure and authorized access to resources in various environments.


## Meeting Notes - Identity Access Management (IAM)

In this section, we'll explore Identity Access Management (IAM) and its significance in controlling access to resources.

### IAM Overview

IAM, short for Identity Access Management, is crucial in ensuring that the right entity or individual has the appropriate access at the right time. When discussing IAM, one prominent system that comes to mind is Microsoft's Active Directory. Although other IAM systems exist, the capabilities of Active Directory, whether in the cloud (Azure) or on-premise, are extensive and impressive.

- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the entity by asking "who are you?"
- **Authorization:** Determines the actions the entity can perform by answering "what can you do?"
- **Identity Management:** Provides interfaces and tools for administrators to manage identities effectively.
- **Repository:** Acts as a database storing information about entities/users needing access to resources.

### IAM Components

1. **Human Resources and CRM Integration:** Employees collaborate with HR and CRM tools to manage identity, with administrators and request approvers controlling access.
2. **Identity Creation:** When a new employee like Kevin King joins, an identity is created in the IAM system, granting access to relevant applications and resources based on their role.

### User Identity Management (IDM)

- **Subset of IAM:** Focuses on ensuring individuals always have a valid identity to access resources securely.
- **Attributes:** Includes username, account number, job role, etc., stored in identity repositories.
- **Example Attributes:** First name, last name, office address, picture, username, password, job title, etc.
- **Integration with Active Directory:** Enables customization and addition of user attributes for efficient identity management.

IAM and IDM play a crucial role in maintaining secure access to resources, ensuring only authorized entities have the necessary privileges at all times.

## User Access Management and Authentication

In this section, we delve into user access management authentication, often abbreviated as AM, adding to our collection of TLAs (Three-Letter Acronyms) and SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

### Authentication Methods

1. **Passwords:** Traditional method involving a user-entered secret phrase.
2. **Smartcards:** Physical cards with embedded chips for secure authentication.
3. **Biometrics:** Uses unique biological traits like fingerprints or iris scans for identity verification.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Combines two authentication factors, such as a password and a mobile OTP (One-Time Password).
5. **Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication:** Enables access to multiple resources with a single login session.

### Understanding Single Sign-On (SSO)

Imagine you're at XYZ Corp on the third floor in a cubicle. Here's how SSO simplifies access:

1. **Printing without SSO:**
   - Select an area in an Excel spreadsheet to print.
   - Hit the print button, which uses your default printer.
   - Without SSO, you'd need to log in again to access printer resources.

2. **Saving to Network Share without SSO:**
   - Save your spreadsheet to a network share.
   - Without SSO, you'd have to log in again to access the network share.

3. **Accessing HR Application without SSO:**
   - Double-click on the HR application to clock out for lunch.
   - Without SSO, you'd need to sign in again to access the HR application.

### Benefits of SSO

- **Seamless Resource Access:** SSO ensures that once authenticated, the trust carries across multiple resources within the same session.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the need for repeated logins and enhances user experience in trusted environments.

SSO simplifies access management by providing a unified authentication experience across various resources, enhancing security and productivity.


## Types of Authentication

Let's explore various types of authentication methods discussed in the previous section:

### Password Authentication

The traditional method where users input a memorized secret phrase. It's crucial to avoid insecure practices like writing passwords on sticky notes under keyboards.

### Smart Card Authentication

Utilizes a smart card with personal cryptography for secure authentication, often connected via USB to laptops or devices.

### Biometric Authentication

One of the factors of authentication (something you are), involving unique biological traits like fingerprints, retina, iris, vein patterns, voice, etc.

#### Retina vs. Iris

- **Retina:** Unique pattern of blood vessels at the back of the eye, scanned for authentication purposes.
- **Iris:** The colored ring around the pupil, 100% unique to individuals, used for iris scanning.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Involves two authentication factors (e.g., something you know and something you have), significantly enhancing security compared to password-only authentication.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Goes beyond 2FA, incorporating three or more authentication factors for heightened security measures.

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication

Allows users to authenticate once and access multiple resources without repeated logins, enhancing user experience and reducing complexity.

SSO and authentication methods like 2FA and MFA play a crucial role in modern security practices, ensuring secure access to resources while minimizing authentication burdens on users.


## User Access Management and Authorization

Let's delve into user access management (AM) and authorization methods discussed in the meeting:

### Centralized Authorization

## Cryptographic Techniques

Cryptography has a long history, dating back to the early days of human communication and civilization. It involves converting plain text into encrypted text using algorithms. This encryption ensures confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of data.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses a single key shared by both parties to encrypt and decrypt messages. Secure key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman facilitate the sharing of keys securely. Symmetric encryption is used for encrypting large amounts of data and is widely used on the Internet.

### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption involves two keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key is shared openly, while the private key must be protected. Asymmetric encryption is suitable for smaller data transactions like email messages.

### Government Access to Keys (GAK)

Some countries require software companies to provide copies of encryption keys to the government for potential decryption in legal cases. This is akin to wiretapping phones and varies by country.

Overall, cryptography plays a vital role in securing data and communications, ensuring privacy and security in digital transactions.


## Cryptographic Algorithms

Cryptographic algorithms are the mathematical and programmatic constructs that enable encryption and decryption of data. They can be classified into classical ciphers and modern ciphers.

### Classical Ciphers

- **Substitution Cipher**: Replaces plaintext with ciphertext using a specific substitution pattern.
- **Transposition Cipher**: Rearranges plaintext characters to create ciphertext.

### Modern Ciphers

Modern ciphers are based on keys and data types:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
  - **DES (Digital Encryption Standard)**: A block cipher, now replaced by AES due to vulnerabilities.
  - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: An iterated block cipher and the current standard for symmetric encryption.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Involves two keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
  - **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**: Used for encryption and authentication over the Internet.
- **RC Algorithms (RC4, RC5, RC6)**: Symmetric key algorithms with different parameterizations and block sizes.

### Digital Signature Algorithms

- **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**: Used for verifying signatures in federal applications.
- **RSA**: Also used for authentication and encryption over the Internet.

These cryptographic algorithms play a crucial role in securing data and communications, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.


## Hashing Algorithms

Hashing is a process that takes input data, such as text or a file, and generates a unique fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. Hashing algorithms play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity, verifying file authenticity, and securing communication.

### MD5 and SHA-1 Hashing

- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**: Generates a 128-bit hash value. Note: MD5 is prone to hash collisions and is not recommended for production environments.
- **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**: Generates a 160-bit hash value. Similar to MD5, SHA-1 is not collision-resistant and is not recommended for high-security applications.

### Secure Hashing Algorithms

- **MD6**: Uses a Merkle tree structure and is designed for parallel computation, long inputs, and differential cryptanalysis.
- **SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)**: Family of secure hashing algorithms with different bit lengths, providing collision resistance and cryptographic security.
- **SHA-3**: Uses a sponge construction and XOR operations, providing enhanced security and resistance against length extension attacks.

### HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)

- **HMAC**: Combines a cryptographic key with a hash function to authenticate messages and ensure data integrity.
  - Uses a core hashing algorithm along with an embedded hash function, enhancing security and mitigating hash collision risks.
